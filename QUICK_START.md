# Quick Start: Control Another Antigravity Session

## Step 1: Get Your Project Path

Find the absolute path to the project you're working on in the other Antigravity window.

**Example paths**:
- `/Users/shauryatiwari/Desktop/MyOtherProject`
- `/Users/shauryatiwari/Documents/Projects/WebApp`

## Step 2: Stop Current Server

If the server is already running for the Mind Map project, stop it:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server
# Or kill the process:
lsof -t -i:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

## Step 3: Run Server for Your Other Project

### Option A: Using the Helper Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd cli
./run-for-project.sh /path/to/your/other/project "Project Name"
```

**Example**:
```bash
./run-for-project.sh /Users/shauryatiwari/Desktop/MyApp "My App"
```

### Option B: Manual Environment Variables

```bash
cd cli
WORKSPACE_PATH="/path/to/your/other/project" \
REASONING_TRACE_PATH="/path/to/your/other/project/reasoning_trace.json" \
DB_PATH="/path/to/your/other/project/.mindmap/agent_mindmap.db" \
node server.js
```

## Step 4: Dashboard is Already Running

The dashboard (http://localhost:3000) is already running and will automatically connect to the server on port 3001.

## Step 5: Work in Your Other Antigravity Window

1. In your other Antigravity window, work on your project as normal
2. Antigravity will generate `reasoning_trace.json` in that project
3. The Mind Map server will detect it and process the steps
4. The dashboard will show the mind map in real-time
5. You can use the dashboard to:
   - **Pause** the agent
   - **Resume** the agent  
   - **Rollback** to previous states
   - **Branch** to explore alternatives

## What Gets Created

When you run the server for your other project, it creates:

```
YourOtherProject/
├── .mindmap/
│   └── agent_mindmap.db          # Sessions and nodes for this project
├── reasoning_trace.json           # Generated by Antigravity
└── .git/                          # Git commits for each step
    └── refs/notes/agent-steps     # Metadata stored as Git notes
```

## Switching Between Projects

To switch back to the Mind Map Visualizer project:

```bash
cd cli
./run-for-project.sh ../workspace "Mind Map Visualizer"
```

To switch to your other project again:

```bash
cd cli
./run-for-project.sh /path/to/your/other/project "Other Project"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "reasoning_trace.json not found"
This is normal! The file will be created when Antigravity starts working in that window.

### "Git initialization error"
Make sure your other project has a Git repository:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/other/project
git init
```

### "Database error"
The database will be created automatically in `.mindmap/agent_mindmap.db` in your project.

### Dashboard shows old sessions
The dashboard shows sessions from the currently active project's database. Switch the server to see different project sessions.

## Next: Tell Me Your Project Path

Please provide:
1. The absolute path to your other project
2. (Optional) A name for the project

Then I'll help you start the server for that project!
